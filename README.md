# bork.js
Bork JS is an esoteric JS library to output text in the dumbest way possible. On average. one character requires 60+ characters to write, and 10+ to print.

The commands are:
- `bork_new(big)` Creates a new entry in a binary string (if big is 0, output smol bork or 0. if big is 1, output bige bork or 1).
- `bork_set()` Gets character for bork list and add it to the buffer
- `bork_reset()` Resets bork index for the next bork list.
- `bork_print()` Resets bork buffer after outputting it.
- `bork_change(id)` Gets element with id and sets text content to bork buffer
